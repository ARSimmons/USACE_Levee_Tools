# <a name="project-summary"></a>Project Summary

The following pdf's are draft products of the now completed NLD Levee Inventory Tools that Michael Baker Jr. (my former employer) was contracted by USACE to create.

These tools were created to be an add-on to the ESRI 9.3 platform. Using VBA and MS Silverlight, these tools were developed over the course of several years (project was already well underway when I began working at Michael Baker) and were completed and delivered to USACE around Summer of 2010.

This project was the first of many development projects that exposed me to working with integrating ESRI products with Silverlight and VBA/VB.Net. It also gave me my first working experience role within a GIS development team. 

Ms. Muenks 2010 ESRI presentation offers more details regarding this project: [USACE Levee Inventory Tools]("http://proceedings.esri.com/library/userconf/feduc10/papers/user/feduc10_muenks_supporting_usa_cenld.pdf "USACE Levee Inventory Tools") .

*NOTE: To the best of my knowledge this project was completed in the Summer of 2010*
